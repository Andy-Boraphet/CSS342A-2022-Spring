## 2022 UWB CSS 342(A) Final Exam (50pt)


**1. (2pt) What's the time complexity of bubble sort and insertion sort, respectively?**
```


```

**2. (2pt) Explain what "collision" means for the hashtable ("dictionary")?** 
```

```

**3. (5pt) Your friend Jimmy (yes, him again) is having trouble with the following code. How to fix all the problems in his code?**
Hint: you can use this [online c++ editor](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler) to play with the code

```c++
int& multiple_by_two(int num) {
  num *= 2;  
  return num;
}
int main()
{
    const int size = 10;
    int *data = new int[size];
    for (int i=0; i<size; i++) {
        data[i] = multiple_by_two(i);
    }
    for (int i=0; i<size; i++) {
        cout<< "value is " << data[i] << endl;
    }
}
```

```




```

**4. (10pt) Given the following code:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
class BaseClass {
protected:
    int capacity;
    int *data;
public:
    BaseClass() = default;
    BaseClass(int capacity) {
        if (capacity < 1) {
            return;
        }
        data = new int[capacity];
        for (int i = 0; i < capacity; i++) {
            data[i] = i + 2;
            std::cout << "I love C++" << std::endl; // 7.4 is asking about this line
        }
    }
    virtual int get_capacity() = 0;
    int operator[](int idx) {
        return data[idx];
    }
    ~BaseClass() {}
};
class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
public:
    DerivedClass(int capacity) {
        this->capacity = capacity;
        data = new int[capacity];
        for (int i = 0; i < capacity; i++) {
            data[i] = (i % 3 == 0) ? (i + 30) : (i + 10);
        }
    }

    int get_capacity() {
        return capacity;
    }
    ~DerivedClass() {
        delete[]data;
    }
};

int main() {
    BaseClass *p_base = new DerivedClass(10);
    for (int i = 0; i < p_base->get_capacity(); i++) {
        std::cout << (*p_base)[i] << std::endl;
    }
    delete p_base;
}
```

**4.1 (2pt) What's the output?**
```


```

**4.2 (2pt) In the following line, what does "=0" mean?**
```
    virtual int get_capacity() = 0;

```

**4.3 (4pt) Running the code as is, valgrind is showing memory leak. How to fix it?**
```
==22708== LEAK SUMMARY:
==22708==    definitely lost: 40 bytes in 1 blocks
```

```



```

**4.4 (2pt) How many times are "I love C++" printed when running the code? And why?**
```


```


**5.1 (15pt) What's the pre-order, in-order and post-order traversal of the following binary tree**
```bash
         5
        / \
       4   7
      /     \
     1       9
            /
           6
```

```
pre-order: 


in-order:


post-order:
```

**5.2 (2pt) Is this tree a BST (binary search tree)? If not, change the value of exactly one node and make it a binary search tree.**
```


```

**5.3 (5pt) Given the root node of a binary tree, write the code that deletes the tree. This means delete all the nodes in the tree without memory leak. Hint: recursion.**
```c++
template<class T>
class BinaryTree;

template<class T>
class TreeNode {
public:
    friend class BinaryTree<T>;

    T val;
    TreeNode<T> *left;
    TreeNode<T> *right;

public:
    TreeNode() : left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}

    TreeNode(const T val) : TreeNode() {
        this->val = val;
    }
};

template<typename T>
void delete_tree(TreeNode<T> *tree) {
    // TODO: add your answer here
}
```


**5.4 (3pt) Use the tree in 12.1 as input to the delete_tree function, and list the nodes in sequence of visit.**
```

```


**6. (4pt) Write the function that implements the Fibonacci sequence.**
Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
```
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
```
Here are some examples:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

**6.1 (2pt) Your code below:**
```c++
int fib(int n) {
       
       
       
}
```

**6.2 (2pt) Explain what is "repeated sub-problem" in recursion? and explain why your code above is free from this problem.**
```


```

**7. (2pt) what's the difference between std::map and std::unordered_map in terms of search performance?**
```


```

**Extra credit 1 (5pt): (5pt) Given two hashmaps, both defined as:**
```c++
std::unordered_map<int, int>
``` 
Design a code to check whether the two maps contain the exact same data as efficient (fast) as possible. 

Code and/or text description of your design both okay.
```



```

**Extra credit 2 (5pt): What's the programming language introduced by the guest speaker, and what are some of the key benefits of it comparing to C++?**
```


```
