### Task 1 (5pt)

The following code is *supposed to* return an array of two numbers and then print these numbers out.

```c++
int *foo_ret_stack_ptr(int size) {
    int array[2] = {12, 34};
    return array;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int *ptr = foo_ret_stack_ptr(2);
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        std::cout << ptr[i] << "\n";
    }
}
```

Please explain the memory usage problem in this code, and how you would fix it.


### Task 2 (10pt)

Given the following lines:

```c++
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int *arr3 = new int[5]{5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
  int *p = &arr3[3];
  *p = 789;
  delete arr3;
}
```

What are all the values in array *arr3* after running this section? (5pt)

Does this code have any memory problem? And if yes, how would you fix it? (5pt)


### Task 3 (10pt)

Given the following lines

```c++
int b = 10, c = -2;
int &a = b;
int &d = a;
a++;  
c -= 2;
a = c;  // here
d = d + 1;
```

What does the line with the comment "here", also shown below, do? (5pt)
```c++
a = c;
```

After running this section, the value of **a** is **-3**. Explain how variable **a** goes from its initial value 10 to -3. (5pt)

### Task 4 (5pt)

Given the following Laptop class

```c++
class Laptop {
private:
    std::string brand;
    int model_year;

public:
    Laptop(const std::string &brand, int modelYear) : brand(brand), model_year(modelYear) {}

    void start_up() {
        std::cout << "laptop " + brand + " (" + std::to_string(model_year) + ") is starting up";
    }
};
```

And this function:

```c++
Laptop *borrow_laptop() {
    Laptop *laptop_loaner = new Laptop("Dell", 2021);
    return laptop_loaner;
}
```

Please explain the issue with the following usage and how you would fix it:

```c++
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    Laptop *my_borrowed_laptop = borrow_laptop();
    my_borrowed_laptop->start_up();
}
```

### Task 5 (10pt)

Your classmate Jimmy is complaining the following code "doesn't work". He's trying to write a function to return the larger of two integers. And in the main function he's calling that function for a quick test.

Your time to shine with your C++ knowledge! 

```c++
void max(int &a, int &b) {
        return (a>=b) ? a : b;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        int x = max(1, 2);
        std::cout << x << std::endl;
}
```

What problem do you see in his code (5pt)? And how would you help him fix it (5pt)?
