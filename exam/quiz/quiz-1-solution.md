## 2022 UWB CSS 342(A) Quiz-1

```
Solution code can be found [here](https://github.com/a-teaching-goose/2022-342-code-along/tree/quiz-1)

Open it in CLion and you can run it.
```

### Task 1 (5pt)

The following code is *supposed to* return an array of two numbers and then print these numbers out.

```c++
int *foo_ret_stack_ptr(int size) {
    int array[2] = {12, 34};
    return array;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int *ptr = foo_ret_stack_ptr(2);
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        std::cout << ptr[i] << "\n";
    }
}
```

Please explain the memory usage problem in this code, and how you would fix it.

**Answer:**
"Dangling pointer". ptr returned from foo_ret_stack_ptr is pointing to invalid address. To fix, use new in the foo_ret_stack_ptr function and return the pointer.

```c++
    int *array = new int[2]{12, 34};
    return array;
```

Also need to delete array in main before finishing. 


### Task 2 (10pt)

Given the following lines:

```c++
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int *arr3 = new int[5]{5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
  int *p = &arr3[3];
  *p = 789;
  delete arr3;
}
```

What are all the values in array *arr3* after running this section? (5pt)

**Answer:**
{5, 6, 7, 789, 9}

Does this code have any memory problem? And if yes, how would you fix it? (5pt)

**Answer:**
Yes, to fix, use:
```c++
delete []arr3;
```

### Task 3 (10pt)

Given the following lines

```c++
int b = 10, c = -2;
int &a = b;
int &d = a;
a++;  
c -= 2;
a = c;  // here
d = d + 1;
```

What does the line with the comment "here", also shown below, do? (5pt)
```c++
a = c;
```

**Answer:**
Assign the value of c, which is -4, to variables referenced by a, which is b and d

After running this section, the value of **a** is **-3**. Explain how variable **a** goes from its initial value 10 to -3. (5pt)

**Answer:**
reference a and d both reference variable b;
a++;

```c++
a++;  // a = 11
c -= 2; // c becomes -4, does not affect a at this line
a = c;  // a (b, d) become -4
d = d + 1; // (a,b,d) become -3 (-4+1), because a is a reference (alias) of b, and d is also a reference (alias) of b
```

### Task 4 (5pt)

Given the following Laptop class

```c++
class Laptop {
private:
    std::string brand;
    int model_year;

public:
    Laptop(const std::string &brand, int modelYear) : brand(brand), model_year(modelYear) {}

    void start_up() {
        std::cout << "laptop " + brand + " (" + std::to_string(model_year) + ") is starting up";
    }
};
```

And this function:

```c++
Laptop *borrow_laptop() {
    Laptop *laptop_loaner = new Laptop("Dell", 2021);
    return laptop_loaner;
}
```

Please explain the issue with the following usage and how you would fix it:

```c++
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    Laptop *my_borrowed_laptop = borrow_laptop();
    my_borrowed_laptop->start_up();
}
```

**Answer:**
add 
```c++
delete my_borrowed_laptop
```
at the end of the main function.

### Task 5 (10pt)

Your classmate Jimmy is complaining the following code "doesn't work". He's trying to write a function to return the larger of two integers. And in the main function he's calling that function for a quick test.

Your time to shine with your C++ knowledge! 

```c++
int max(int &a, int &b) {
    return (a>=b) ? a : b;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int x = max(1, 2);
    std::cout << x << std::endl;
}
```

What problem do you see in his code (5pt)? And how would you fix it (5pt)?

**Answer:**
problem: code won't compile because max function is take references as parameters while main is passing in integer values, which are not variables to match the reference parameter in function max.

To fix, use variables to call max

```c++
    int a = 1, b = 2;
    int x = max(a, b);
    std::cout << x << std::endl;
```
