### Extension
Deadline extension will not be granted if **BOTH** the following conditions are true:

1. ***Foreseeable situation***, meaning if the reason of extension request can be forseen long before a deadline, for example, at the time when a homework is assigned. For this case, there should be plenty of time to schedule around the issue and make it to the deadline
