## Homework Deadline Policy

### Extension
Deadline extension will not be granted if **BOTH** the following conditions are true:

1. ***Foreseeable situation***, meaning if the reason of extension request can be forseen long before a deadline, for example, at the time when a homework is assigned. For this case, there should be plenty of time to schedule around the issue and make it to the deadline
2. ***Person reason***, meaning the reason does not apply to all the students.

If only the 2nd of the above reasons is true, please reach out to the instructor to discuss. 

No extension will be given if the reason of request is foreseeable.
