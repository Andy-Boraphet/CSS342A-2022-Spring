## Spring into Action

### Dates

    - Assigned: 03/30/2022
    - Due: Tuesday Apr 05 23:59:00 PST 2022

## Goals ##

- C++ programming basics.
- Write your own tests.
- Get familiar with Git and Github ([Great tuturial from Harvard's CS50](https://youtu.be/MJUJ4wbFm_A))
- Get comfortable with the grading submission process.

### Problems To Solve

There are **THREE** problems to solve. Please find the description of the first 2 problem in their own page:

- [Problem 1](problem_1.md) (30pt)
- [Problem 2](problem_2.md) (30pt)
- [Problem 3](problem_3.md) (30pt)
- Problem 4 has 10 point as following: Send me a private message in Discord. Describe the following:
  - Your full name.
  - Your technical background. For example, What programming language do you know? Have you used Java before? If yes, on what kind of projects? What's the biggest challenge in those projects?
  - How much do you know about data structures such as array, list, tree, graph?
  - How much do you konw about algorithms such as sorting, searching and recursion?
  - What do you like about programming?
  - What do you struggle the most learning about programming?
  - Feeling of the class so far and suggestions. Is it too fast? Too slow? Lecture too long? My accent hard to understand? Need more explanation on topics? 
  - Will you be willing to have a 15-min 1 on 1 chat over zoom sometime. Goal is to get to know each other further to help with the my teaching and your studying?

### Code Correctness ###

Your code is as correct as what the Github PR tests prove.

### Code Repo ###

Here is the code that your solution will be based on: 

Assignment Repo: https://github.com/a-teaching-goose/2022-342-sprint-1 (Homework submission without using this provided code will receive 0 point)

General requirements (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Do not create any new file or delete existing file in the repo. The grader bot checks for this.
- Do not make modification to any file outside the ***src*** and ***test*** folders.
- Do not make modification to any file that has warning "DO NOT TOUCH THIS FILE" at the top in src and test.


### Work Instruction
- Create your own account at https://github.com/ if you don't have an account.
- Fork (means "duplicate") the instructor repo https://github.com/a-teaching-goose/2022-342-sprint-1 to your own repo.
- In the Action tab of the repo, click the green button to enable Action.
- Open your own repo in Intellij using "Get From Version Control".
- Create a new branch called "work" (you can pick your own name here), and switch to this new branch (automatically in Intellij).
- Finish the homework in the "work" branch. Make commits and push frequently so your work is kept online safely. The first time when you push online, Intellij will ask you to log in with token or OATH. Token is the easiest way. [Here's an instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). This will also be demo'd in lecture.
- Once the homework is ready to for submission, head to your own repo on Github and create a pull request from your "work" branch towards ***your master branch***. NOTE: DO NOT CREATE THE PULL REQUEST TOWARDS THE INSTRUCTOR'S REPO. TEST WILL FAIL IF YOU DO.
- Submit the url of your pull request in Canvas.
- DO NOT make new code commits after submission deadline. Violation will be treated as late homework.
- Once grading is done, teacher will mark the PR as "approved" and grade will be published to Canvas.

A demo of this process can be found in the lecture recording of lecture of week 1.

### Notes ###

- Start early. Be active. Ask questions.
- Partial credits will be given. If you cannot finish some part, add comments describing your thinking.
- OK to search web for help. Give credits in your code if you use any. 
- Homework is to be done by yourself. Okay to discuss with others. 
- Late submission without explanation AND permission will receive **ZERO** point.  
- Read grader and teacher's code review comments. Be open to accept them for improvement but be prepared to defend your choice. 

### Code of Conduct

Plagarism will not be tolerated and will receive **ZERO** point, this includes (but not limited to)

- Copy others' code line by line.
- Copy online resources line by line, with or without giving credits.

Offense will be reported to the department.
