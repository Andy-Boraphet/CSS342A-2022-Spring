## (30pt) Bubble Sort

### Implement The Bubble Sort (20pt)
Implement bubble sort for an integer array.

If you need help with bubble sort, [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/) is a good start. 

Requirements:

- Sorted result is in ascending order, e.g. for input [3,1,4,0], output would be [0,1,3,4]. **Use given tests as a manual.**
- In-place, which means, O(1) space complexity. No additional memory of the size of the input array is allowed. If not sure, clarify with the teacher.

When this homework is correctly done, all provided tests should pass.

### Fix The Tests (10pt)

Tests are given for bubble sort, however, one of the tests is missing something, and will fail even if you bubble sort is correct. This failure would definitely show up when Nop the cat (github PR robot) inspects your code.

And you are to fix it so all tests pass.
