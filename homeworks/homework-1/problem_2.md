## (30pt) Bubble Sort

Implement bubble sort for an integer array.

Bubble sort will be also discussed in class. If you need help with it, [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/) is a good start. 

Requirements:

- Ascending order, e.g. for input [3,1,4,0], output would be [0,1,3,4]. **Use given tests as a manual.**
- In-place, aka O(1) space complexity. No additional memory of the size of the input array is allowed. Not sure, clarify with the teacher.

When this homework is correctly done, all provided tests should pass.
