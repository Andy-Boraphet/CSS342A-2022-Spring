- Problems such as single-choice question, discussion, and coding
- Midterms are incremental (covering material up to the exam date), and final exam is comprehensive (covering everything).
- There will be reviews and examples given before midterms and final.
- Quiz is similarly to homework except no question and discussion will be given by instructor on solution before submission. 
- There might be in-class quiz during lecture.
