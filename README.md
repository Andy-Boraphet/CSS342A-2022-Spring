## Class Communication
- **Canvas** for assigning tasks (homework, quizzes, and exams) and scores.
- **Discord** for announcements, discussion forums, assignment posting, and individual grades. Choose this if in doubt.
- **Email** barely use but will reply probably asking you to use the above two methods

### Coursework Distribution
| Course Work | Grading % |
|-------------|-----------|
| Homeworks | 35        |
| Quiz & in-class exercises      | 5   |
| Midterm exam       | 20       |
| Final projects 1 | 10 |
| Final projects 2 | 10 |
| Final exam      | 20        |
| Total | 100 |

### Grading Rubric
All grades will be listed as percentages in the Canvas LMS. The conversion table below will help you determine your final grade. For example, if you earn 950 points (or 95%) you will get a 4.0. If you earn 750 points (or 75%) you will earn a 2.0.

## Exams (quiz, midterms and final)

- Possibly in-class or "take-home" style depending on Covid situation. Each will be ~1.5 hr.
- Problems such as single-choice question, discussion, and coding
- Midterms are incremental (covering material up to the exam date), and final exam is comprehensive (covering everything).
- There will be reviews and examples given before midterms and final.
- Quiz is similarly to homework except no question and discussion will be given by instructor on solution before submission. 
- There might be in-class quiz during lecture.

## Textbook
- Data Abstraction & Problem Solving With C++: Wallsâ€¯& Mirrors, Sixth or Seventh Edition, Frank M. Carrano, Addison Wesley, 2013, ISBN-10: 0132923726, ISBN-13: 978-0132923729
- (Free PDF) [An Active Introduction to Discrete Mathematics and Algorithms, Charles Cusack, David Santos, GNU Free Software, 2014](https://cusack.hope.edu/Notes/Notes/Books/Active%20Introduction%20to%20Discrete%20Mathematics%20and%20Algorithms/ActiveIntroToDiscreteMathAndAlgorithms.2.6.3.pdf)

Here's the [full list](https://github.com/a-teaching-goose/CSS342A-2022-Spring/blob/main/books.md) of books including optional and recommended.

## Class Goal
The goals of this course are for students to: 

- Be comfortable with OOP programming and debugging in C++
- Excise and reinforce the knowledge about fundamental data structures and algorithms, and as a result improve problem solving skills
- Adopt the "clean code" (e.g. [this](https://youtu.be/AeWbJ5LIFNg) and [this too](https://youtu.be/4F72VULWFvc)) mindset via the practice of TDD ([Test Driven Development](https://youtu.be/d1EAyR_NCOA))
- Practice and adopt the use of source control system
- Be exposed to IT-industry popular development tools such as CMake, CLion, Git/Github/CICD, Vim, cloud and virtual machine, CICD

## Lecture
- Read the relevant textbook chapters before each class.
- There will be live "code-along" in lecutre. Have a running dev environment ready for each lecture.
- Lecture will be recorded to the best effort. Video, PPT slides and demo code from class will be available shortly after each lecture.
- PPT Slides are for reference only and tentative to change even after lecture.
- Take notes. Write down your questions in class and follow up later.
